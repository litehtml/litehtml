// Parameters:
//-----------
// str = the input string that will be tokenized
// result = the tokens for str
// delimiters = the delimiter characters
// delimiters preserve = same as above, but the delimiter characters
//		will be put into the result as a token
// quote = characters to protect the enclosed characters
// esc = characters to protect a single character
